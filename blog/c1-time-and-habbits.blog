    The first technique that i tried was meditation was interesting reading
    benifits it had on your mind and focus will be something to conintue 
    as course goes on,the Pomodoro technique was aslway a good read found itersting becasue 
    it is how I kinda work anyway. 
    was intersting looking at tricks for getting into and staying in the zone
    becasue i find i do have trouble getting into or staying focused .
    Main things that i will foucus on using will be meditation , habbit forming
    and tricks to stay in zone.
    did give meditation a try and found that it did help me focus better 
    on large walls of text.
