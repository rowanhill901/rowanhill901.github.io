    My take on EDA is a positive one I think that it is a cool diferent
      new way to learn.
    even tho it can be a scary new enviorment 
    and hard to get into once started can be a fun .
     
    I don't really have many exspectaions , just that the journey will be tough 
    but in the end I will have a new skill and a new view on how computers work
    and what they can do and what i can acomplish.
    I am not the biggest people person so interacting with the community 
    will most likly be my biggest problem but assume that I will be able to find
    nice like minded people to be able to work together with and find common instrests.
    I am not looking foward to not knowing alot of things and having to ask for help
    and it makes me very nervous because of socal anxiety.
    and quick way to gain a new skill<!DOCTYPE html>
